    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit">I stood at the edge of Lake Serenity, the sun glistening on the water&#x27;s surface. <span class="r1">&quot;Do you remember when we built that </span>
<span class="r1">terrible raft for the summer camp?&quot;</span> I asked Sarah, grinning. Her laughter echoed in my ears, reminding me of our 
countless summer adventures here in Cascade Valley.
<span class="r1">&quot;Of course! You insisted we could float on those old crates,&quot;</span> she replied, brushing a strand of her sun-kissed hair 
behind her ear. <span class="r1">&quot;I still can’t believe we almost sank!&quot;</span>
As kids, we had lofty dreams. I, <span class="r2">Ethan</span> <span class="r2">Rivers</span>, had my sights set on becoming the youngest environmental scientist in 
the state, while Sarah aimed to win the annual Cascade Valley Art Fair with her stunning paintings of the local 
landscape. 
Just then, a group of teenagers raced by, their laughter slicing through the nostalgia. <span class="r1">&quot;What do you think they’re up </span>
<span class="r1">to?&quot;</span> I pondered aloud, taking in the vibrant scene.
<span class="r1">&quot;Probably planning their own summer escapades,&quot;</span> she said, her blue eyes sparkling. <span class="r1">&quot;You know, like we used to.&quot;</span>
I smiled, knowing no matter where life took us, the memories of those carefree days would forever remain etched in my 
heart, shaped by the shimmering waves of Lake Serenity.
